# File System Practice

You will implemenet two small programs to explore the file system. You must work in groups of three to four!

Ways to make this easier:
* Read the comments at the top of each file before starting!
* READ THE DOCUMENTATION
* Ask questions

We will go over the solutions later in the week!
